      "<p>The Bilingual ISFC Clinician is responsible for both the clinical treatment and case management of up to eight children placed in Seneca foster family agency programs. Seneca’s ISFC program serves children aged 6-18 who have emotional and behavioral challenges due to histories of trauma, neglect and abuse. In this home-based, therapeutic approach, Seneca foster parents are valued team members who receive weekly support and guidance from Seneca clinicians and counselors. With a focus on the strengths and value of each child, the team helps foster youth to recover and flourish as they learn coping skills and improve their ability to regulate feelings and behaviors.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "<p>ISFC is Seneca Center's primary foster care program.

Youth referred are typically not able to maintain placement in a standard foster home or are stepping down from residential placement. Families work with a social worker and support counselor, in addition to outside therapists, teachers, counselors, county&nbsp;social workers, and other involved in the child's care to develop and implement a thoughtful plan to address client and family needs.</p>\n",
